Where to Get Help
=================

Source: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/getting-help-as-a-contributor

As you're building PyTorch, if you find yourself in a position where you're stuck or you have an idea for improving your workflow, there are multiple venues you can reach out at:

PyTorch Contributor Forum
=========================

The `PyTorch Dev Discussions <https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/>`_ forum is for anyone who is making contributions to PyTorch. 

It's a place to ask for help and share ideas

File an Issue
=============

File an issue against the Developer Experience (DevX) team when you want some aspect of your code->test->submit workflow fixed.

This could be a bug with the tooling, frustrations you felt while trying to submit your PR, or something feature that you really wish we had.

To get the DevX team to see your bug faster, file the issue `here <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/new/choose>`_ and then add it to the `PyTorch OSS DevX` project (leave the `Status` blank)

!`Assign it to the PyTorch OSS DevX Project <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4468967/201147013-c00809f5-4791-4a5e-9f5f-bd1cf10186a9.jpeg>`_


DevX Office Hours
=================

We offer office hours most weeks on Friday, open to everyone. You can bring up problems you're running into or ask about any piece of infrastructure you're curious about.

For details on how to join see `DevX Office Hours <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Dev-Infra-Office-Hours>`_

Slack Channel (Advanced Contributors)
=====================================

For power users who've made multiple contributions or participated significantly on the forums, we also have a Slack channel to discuss advanced topics.

If you'd like to join, you can `file a request <https://pytorch.org/resources/>`_
